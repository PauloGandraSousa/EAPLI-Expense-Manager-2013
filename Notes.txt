several discussions migth be raised:
1) which layers?
2) domain objects with persistence knowledge or not
3) passing domain objects to the UI or not 
4) performing calculations in memory or directly at the persistence layer
5) factoring out common behaviour, e.g., IncomeType & ExpenseType, Income & Expense
6) having the explicit concept of account or not
7) initial balance of the account
8) can controllers call other controllers?
9) Lazy load and filtering of the movements collection (CheckingAccount)
10) have a single collection of movements or two separate colections for expenses and another for incomes?
11) SavingsPlan + SavingsRecord OR Savings as a single aggregate composed of Goals and Goal composed of Savings?
12) should the UI/controller create domain objects directly, e.g., Payment, ExpenseType

1) which layers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

the application follows a traditional approach of separating the following layers:
	UI | use case controllers | domain/model | persistence
access to the busines logic is guarded by use case controllers
 
generaly speaking the persistence layer is organized around the concept of Repository
(a class acting as an in memory list) that "takes care" of the objects.
to accomodate both in-memory and database repositories the persistence layer is actually 
composed of interfaces and a PersistenceRegistry which acts as a registry and as a factory
of the actual repository implementation (this can also be seen as a case of the Strategy pattern)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) domain objects with persistence knowledge or not
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

two different approaches are possible:
- pure domain objects without any knowledge of the persistence
- domain objects that can save and load thenselves from persistence (thus, an Active Record)

in the first case, the controller is responsible for obtaining the domain objects 
from the repository, asking the domain objects to perform the business logic and then pass
them back to the repository. in this case, the domain objects can "easily" be tested as 
they do not depend on any other package
this gets trickier whe we need/want ot have lazy load of collections...

see alternative A in picture "package diagrams"


in the second case, the controller asks the domain object class to load a certain instance,
asks that object to perform the business operation and then asks the object to save itself
back to the database

see alternative B in picture "package diagrams"

3) passing domain objects to the UI or not 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) performing calculations in memory or directly at the persistence layer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------




--------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) factoring out common behaviour, e.g., IncomeType & ExpenseType, Income & Expense
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
6) having the explcit concept of account or not
--------------------------------------------------------------------------



--------------------------------------------------------------------------
7) initial balance of the account
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
8) can controllers call other controllers?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------



--------------------------------------------------------------------------
9) Lazy load and filtering of the movements collection (CheckingAccount)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
10) have a single collection of movements or two separate colections for expenses and another for incomes?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
11) SavingsPlan + SavingsRecord OR Savings as a single aggregate composed of Goals and Goal composed of Savings?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
12) should the UI/controller create domain objects directly, e.g., Payment, ExpenseType
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

should the rules fo rth eCreator pattern be fully enforced, e.g., the responsibility to 
create a Payment should be of Expense, or can the controller/UI create a Payment and pass it
to the Expense?
