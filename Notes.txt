several discussions migth be raised:
1) which layers?
2) domain objects with persistence knowledge or not
3) passing domain objects to the UI or not 
4) performing calculations in memory or directly at the persistence layer
5) factoring out common behaviour, e.g., IncomeType & ExpenseType, Income & Expense
6) having the explicit concept of account or not
7) initial balance of the account
8) can controllers call other controllers?
9) Lazy load and filtering of the movements collection (CheckingAccount)
10) have a single collection of movements or two separate colections for expenses and another for incomes?
11) SavingsPlan + SavingsRecord OR Savings as a single aggregate composed of Goals and Goal composed of Savings?

1) which layers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

the application follows a traditional approach of separating the following layers:
	UI | use case controllers | domain/model | persistence
access to the busines logic is guarded by use case controllers
 
generaly speaking the persistence layer is organized around the concept of Repository
(a class acting as an in memory list) that "takes care" of the objects.
to accomodate both in-memory and database repositories the persistence layer is actually 
composed of interfaces and a PersistenceRegistry which acts as a registry and as a factory
of the actual repository implementation (this can also be seen as a case of the Strategy pattern)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) domain objects with persistence knowledge or not
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

two different approaches are possible:
- pure domain objects without any knowledge of the persistence
- domain objects that can save and load thenselves from persistence (thus, an Active Record)

in the first case, the controller is responsible for obtaining the domain objects 
from the repository, asking the domain objects to perform the business logic and then pass
them back to the repository. in this case, the domain objects can "easily" be tested as 
they do not depend on any other package

see alternative A in picture

in the second case, the controller asks the domain object class to load a certain instance,
asks that object to perform the business operation and then asks the object to save itself
back to the database

3) passing domain objects to the UI or not 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) performing calculations in memory or directly at the persistence layer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) factoring out common behaviour, e.g., IncomeType & ExpenseType, Income & Expense
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
6) having the explicit concept of account or not
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
7) initial balance of the account
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
8) can controllers call other controllers?

9) when showing movements gruped by type, who performs the sum operation? UI, Controller or CheckingAccount?
---
* the UI might not be smart enough to compute the total sum with enough precision, and would carry a burden for the computer running the interface
* the Controller might indeed perform such calculation has it has all the data is needs for a short period of time, but it is not the controller function to perform mathematical operations
* the CheckingAccount might indeed be the very best resource to calculate the sum for each expense type, but it would not make sense to delegate the CheckingAccount to the interface. **NMB TODO** verificar o que faz sentido mover at√© o interface

10) when showing movements gruped by type, should types with no values also appear? 
---
this can be another strategy

---
11) Should Controllers be specialized by other Use Cases?

12) Should UI be specialized by other Use Cases?
