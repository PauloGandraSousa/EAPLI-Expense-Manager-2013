=======================

This application serves as "play ground" for the lab project of EAPLI.

Parts of the application were developed to show specific approaches or 
techniques; as such, the overall application is not consistent in terms of design.
for production ready code this would obvisously be a problem as we should strive for 
consistency. in this case, it is acceptable as the inconsistencies are meant to provide
samples of different valid approaches.
